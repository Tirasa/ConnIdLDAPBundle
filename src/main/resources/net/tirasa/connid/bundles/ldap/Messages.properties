List all servers in the form of "ldap://ldap.example.com:389/", which follows the standard LDAP v3 URLs described in RFC 2255. Only the host and port parts of the URL are relevant in this setting.

When entering more than one object class, each entry should be on its own line; do not use commas or semi-colons to separate multiple object classes. Some object classes may require that you specify all object classes in the class hierarchy.
accountUserNameAttributes.display=Account User Name Attributes

passwordHashAlgorithm.display=Password Hash Algorithm
passwordHashAlgorithm.help=Indicates the algorithm that the Identity system should use to hash the password. Currently supported values are SSHA, SHA, SMD5, and MD5. A blank value indicates that the system will not hash passwords. This will cause cleartext passwords to be stored in LDAP unless the LDAP server performs the hash (Netscape Directory Server and iPlanet Directory Server do).
respectResourcePasswordPolicyChangeAfterReset.display=Respect Resource Password Policy Change-After-Reset
respectResourcePasswordPolicyChangeAfterReset.help=When this resource is specified in a Login Module (i.e., this resource is a pass-through authentication target) and the resource''s password policy is configured for change-after-reset, a user whose resource account password has been administratively reset will be required to change that password after successfully authenticating.

objectClassesToSynchronize.help=The object classes to synchronize. The change log is for all objects; this filters updates to just the listed object classes. You should not list the superclasses of an object class unless you intend to synchronize objects with any of the superclass values. For example, if only "inetOrgPerson" objects should be synchronized, but the superclasses of "inetOrgPerson" ("person", "organizationalperson" and "top") should be filtered out, then list only "inetOrgPerson" here. All objects in LDAP are subclassed from "top". For this reason, you should never list "top", otherwise no object would be filtered. Default is "inetOrgPerson".
attributesToSynchronize.display=Attributes to Synchronize
attributesToSynchronize.help=The names of the attributes to synchronize. This ignores updates from the change log if they do not update any of the named attributes. For example, if only "department" is listed, then only changes that affect "department" will be processed. All other updates are ignored. If blank (the default), then all changes are processed.
modifiersNamesToFilterOut.display=Filter Out Changes By
modifiersNamesToFilterOut.help=The names (DNs) of directory administrators to filter from the changes. Changes with the attribute "modifiersName" that match entries in this list will be filtered out. The standard value is the administrator name used by this adapter, to prevent loops. Entries should be of the format "cn=Directory Manager".
accountSynchronizationFilter.display=LDAP Filter for Accounts to Synchronize
accountSynchronizationFilter.help=An optional LDAP filter for the objects to synchronize. Because the change log is for all objects, this filter updates only objects that match the specified filter. If you specify a filter, an object will be synchronized only if it matches the filter and includes a synchronized object class.

removeLogEntryObjectClassFromFilter.display=Remove Log Entry Object Class from Filter
removeLogEntryObjectClassFromFilter.help=If this property is set (the default), the filter used to fetch change log entries does not contain the "changeLogEntry" object class, expecting that there are no entries of other object types in the change log. Default is "true".
